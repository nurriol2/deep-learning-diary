# Deep Learning Diary #

I started my Deep Learning Diary because I wanted to emphasize that the project is very personal. I specifically decided to call it a *diary*, instead of just a traditional blog. 

I wouldn't know even half of what I know about coding or machine learning if it weren't for excellent writers consistently publishing on their blogs for free. I will certainly highlight those authors whenever I come across their material.

When I read those articles, I trust that the author has a plan for what I should learn and I know they will get me there by the end of the article. Even if I have to re-read a few times! With my Deep Learning Diary, *there is no plan.* 

This project is a chance for me to normalize running into dead-ends, to talk about failure, and to tear out pages and try again. To that end, my posts will focus on asking lots of questions about deep learning and detailing the steps I take (even the ones in the *wrong direction*) to answer these questions.

I sincerely hope that by sharing my learning experience here I can inspire you to build your own projects, answer some questions you didn't know you had, and demonstrate that deep learning is a field for problem solvers-not just PhDs. 

# Myself #
My name is Elliot. I recieved my BSc. Physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2019, where I was a biological physics researcher for 2 years. I'm currently a maths educator for grades K-12. When I'm not teaching my students, I'm teaching myself Data Science so I can take the next step in my career.
