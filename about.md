# Deep Learning Diary #

When I started my Deep Learning Diary, I wanted to emphasize the fact that the project is very personal. So I specifically decided to call it a *diary*, instead of just a traditional blog. 

I wouldn't know even half of what I know about machine learning if it weren't for excellent writers consistently publishing articles on their blogs for free. In these posts, I will certainly highlight those authors.

But when I read those articles, I trust that the author has a goal in mind and that they reach it by the end of the article. Even if I have to re-read a few times! With my Deep Learning Diary, *there is no predetermined route.* 

This project is a chance for me to normalize running into dead-ends, to talk about failure, and to tear out pages and try again.

I sincerely hope that by sharing my experience through this website, I can contribute to breaking the illusion that deep learning concepts need to be divined from the heavens by people with PhDs. 

# Myself #
My name is Elliot. I recieved my BSc. Physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2019 where I was a biological physics researcher for 2 years. I'm currently a maths educator for grades K-12. When I'm not teaching my students, I'm teaching myself Data Science so I can start the next step in my career.
