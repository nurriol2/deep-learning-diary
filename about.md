# Myself #
My name is Elliot. I recieved my BSc. Physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2019, where I was a biological physics researcher for 2 years. I'm currently a maths educator for grades K-12 and young adults. When I'm not teaching my students, I'm teaching myself Data Science so I can take the next step in my career.
