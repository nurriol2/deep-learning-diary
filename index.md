## Welcome to My Deep Learning Diary ##

Artificial intelligence can be an effective tool for solving many hard problems and building cutting-edge products. But just like any other tool, I need to learn how to use it. There is no better way to learn how to use a new tool than to build something (or many things) with it.

**My Deep Learning Diary** is an open research notebook for sharing my AI based projects. I hope that others can read it to find inspiration, learn something new, or see a fresh approach to topics in artificial intelligence. 

If you're familiar with AI jargon already, don't be fooled by the title! *Deep Learning* is an important and exciting subject within AI, but that is just one of many areas I hope to cover.
