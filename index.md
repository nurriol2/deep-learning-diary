## A Word on Notes ##

Many posts will be tagged as "Notes". These posts are just my personal notes I took down while reading a deep learning book, watching a lecture, or something along those lines.

These notes can be a good place to see what a chapter might cover, but they are highly biased toward my own (mis)understanding of the chapter. 

I believe one of the best ways to learn something is to try teaching it. So, I will make tutorial posts available on certain topics. Tutorial posts are more comprehensive and thorough than my notes.
