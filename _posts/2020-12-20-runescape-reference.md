Several projects found in this diary require some knowledge of an online game called *Runescape*. I'm writing this post as a singular point of reference for those who might be unfamiliar.

# *Runescape* is made by Jagex #
Jagex Limited (or Jagex) are a British video game company based in Cambridge, England and the creators of *Runescape*. 

Jagex developers regularly push new content and patches to the game. Sometimes, these game updates drastically change the game meta. 

# There are different versions of *Runescape* #
The three versions of the game are:

1. *Runescape - Classic*
2. *Old School Runescape* (OSRS)
3. *Runescape 3* (RS3)

The official *Runescape - Classic* is not available to play anymore. However, *Old School Runescape* and *Runescape 3* are very active. While the two versions are rooted in the same fictional universe, the game mechanics and in-game content are distinct.

*Old School Runescape* is the only version of the game my projects are concerned with.

# *Runescape* is multiplayer #
With servers across U.S.A and Europe, millions of players are on OSRS at any given time.

In 2019, Jagex recorded 1.1 million subscribers with many more enjoying the free-to-play parts of the game [[1]](https://www.pcgamesn.com/runescape/player-count#:~:text=%E2%80%9CJagex's%20RuneScape%20franchise%20achieved%20its,%2Dto%2Daccess%20content.%E2%80%9D).

Players can chat with one another, as well as trade items and in-game currency - more on this later.

# Basic Gameplay - Player Skills #
The basic objective of the game is to maximize the experience points in one or more skills. Some skills are combat based, whereas others are processing based.

Players can train their skills by doing different activities throughout the world. For example, fighting monsters can give experience ponits for the Attack, Strength, or Defense skill. Processing flax into bowstring gives experience for the Crafting skill.

Some training methods are more efficient or profitable than others. Quantifying these benefits for a player's skill levels generally defines the game meta. 

New content can also bring new ways to train skills. With every addition, players are quick to gauge its viability and share optimized playing strategies.

# Basic Gameplay - Items and Gold #
The in-game currency are gold pieces (gp). There are some derivative currencies, but all projects will use gp for price units.

Trading items and gp between players is a major part of the game. The tradeability of an item defines if and how an item is traded.


Items traded on the game market (see The Grand Exchange - How it works) are exclusively exchanged for gp.

Items can also be traded between 2 players in close proximity of each other. In this kind of trade, players are free to exchange whichever tradeable items in whatever amount they wish (unequal trades are possible). The trade will go through, so long as both players accept.

Untradeable items cannot be traded on the game market or between players.

There are exceptions for some items, but most projects will not deal with those items.

# The Grand Exchange - How it works #

The Grand Exchange (GE) is a trading system for players to buy and sell in-game items for gold pieces. 

When creating a listing (buying or selling) on the GE, players must specify the price point and the number of items in the listing.

A listing will remain on the GE until it is completely fufilled. A completely fufilled order for the buyer means they recieved the desired quantity of an item, each purchased at or below the "buy for" price point. A completely fufilled order for the seller means they recieved gold equal to or greater than the "sell for" price point for each item in the listing.

Certain items have a buy limit which puts an upper limit on the number of that item a player can buy, every few hours.

The mechanism that matches orders is beyond the scope of this guide.

Using the GE requires the character to be in the GE area and interact with a GUI.
